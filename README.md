# California Housing Price Prediction

## Introduction
This project is focused on predicting housing prices in California using the California Housing dataset. The aim is to apply machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions of housing prices based on various features.

## Project Description
The Jupyter notebook is structured as follows:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading the California Housing dataset and preparing it for analysis. This step includes handling missing values and normalizing data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performing analysis through visualizations and statistical methods to uncover patterns and insights from the data.
3. **Model Building**: Building a predictive model using the Random Forest algorithm, known for its robustness and accuracy in handling regression tasks.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics suitable for regression analysis.

## Conclusion
The Random Forest model applied to the California Housing dataset likely revealed significant insights into the factors influencing house prices in California. Key findings might include the importance of location, size, and other features in determining housing prices. The model's performance, judged by metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), should give an indication of its accuracy in making predictions. Future work could involve tuning the model for better accuracy, trying different modeling techniques, or incorporating more recent data to reflect current market trends.
